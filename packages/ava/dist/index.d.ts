     * Convenient wrapper around AVA's test function and near-runner's `runner.run`.
     * In local sandbox mode, each `runner.test` will:
     *
     *   - start a new local blockchain
     *   - copy the state from the blockchain created in `Runner.create`
     *   - get access to the accounts created in `Runner.create` using the same variable names
     *   - run concurrently with all other `runner.test` calls, keeping data isolated
     *   - shut down at the end, forgetting all new data created
     *
     * In testnet mode, the same functionality is achieved via different means,
     * since all actions must occur on one blockchain instead of N blockchains.
     *
     * It's also worth knowing that `runner.test` is syntax sugar added by
     * near-runner-ava. With raw AVA + near-runner, here's how to write a test:
     *
     *     import avaTest from 'ava';
     *     import {Runner} from 'near-runner';
     *     // Alternatively, you can import Runner and ava both from near-runner-ava:
     *     // import {ava as avaTest, Runner} from 'near-runner-ava';
     *
     *     const runner = Runner.create(...);
     *
     *     avaTest('some behavior', async test => {
     *       await runner.run(async ({root, ...}) => {
     *         ...
     *       });
     *     });
     *
     * Instead, with the syntax sugar, you can write this as you see it below â€“
     * saving an indentation level and avoiding one extra `await`.
     *
